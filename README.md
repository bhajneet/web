## About

This is our end-user facing product for all things Shabad OS. It hosts our blog, support articles, and documentation for developers. Eventually the goal is to integrate the Viewer into this product. Under the hood, it's using Qwik with [Qwik City](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). Qwik is configured with an adapter to deploy to [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions), which means it will be rendered at an edge location near to users.
