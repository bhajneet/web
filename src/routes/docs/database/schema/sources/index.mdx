# Sources

The `Sources` table provides a list of published source materials used in the database (e.g. `SGPC`, `Budha Dal Mehron`).

It is possible to have multiple `Sources` for the same [`Lines`](/docs/database/schema/lines), since it is possible for the same line to vary slightly between source materials. This allows comparing different, but widely authenticated, publications for the same composition.

Use this to select which Gurbani source that [`Lines`](/docs/database/schema/lines) will be displayed from.

## Columns
