# Lines

The `Lines` table contains all the Sikh bani and panthic content, across all sources.

Many lines must belong to one [Shabad](/docs/database/schema/shabads).

The content is unordered by default, and must be ordered by `order_id`. The `id` is a four-letter, immutable identifier that will refer to the same line across database versions.

Currently, the `gurmukhi` stores an ASCII representation of Gurbani. They may be converted to unicode with [`gurmukhi-utils`](/gurmukhi-utils).

## Columns
