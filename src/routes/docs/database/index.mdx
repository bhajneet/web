# Install the Shabad OS Database

There are 2 officially supported release formats:
[SQLite](https://github.com/ShabadOS/database/releases) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shabados/database).

Note: Refrain from modifying any existing content of the database. If you believe there is a mistake, please file an issue for any specific line using the [Shabad OS Viewer](/support/learn-how-to-proofread) or more generally at [GitHub](https://github.com/shabados/database/issues). The only exception to this rule is that tables or data that you do not require may be dropped entirely to save storage space in constrained environments.

## SQLite

Our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ShabadOS/database/releases) contain the latest SQLite3 database releases. [Read about the schema used](/docs/database/schema/overview).

These releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so it is possible to download databases with content additions and fixes without breaking your application.

Running `SELECT * FROM Lines ORDER BY order_id LIMIT 100` will return the first 100 lines that the database contains, in the correct order. [See more example queries](/docs/database/usage/queries).

## npm

The database is packaged as an npm module [@shabados/database](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shabados/database). To install it, run `npm install @shabados/database`. Importing the package will give you access to the location of the database.

This package uses the same [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) format as the SQLite database, so running `npm update` will allow you to retrieve compatible database corrections without breaking your application. Additionally, there is a JavaScript API that can be imported from the package, allowing you to leverage the database using wrapper functions, without the need to write SQL.
