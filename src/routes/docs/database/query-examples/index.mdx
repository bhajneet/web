# Common SQL Query Examples

The queries below correspond to the latest version of the [SQLite Database](https://github.com/shabados/database/releases/latest).

These can be implemented in the programming language of choice, or alternatively executed using a database viewer such as [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).

## Given some first letters, retrieve any matching Lines

```sql
SELECT * FROM lines
JOIN line_content ON line_content.line_id = lines.id
WHERE line_content.first_letters LIKE '%hhhh%'
ORDER BY order_id
```

`hhhh` is starting letters of the first 4 words in the line.

## Given a Shabad ID, retrieve the Lines

```sql
SELECT * FROM lines WHERE shabad_id = '9N9' ORDER BY order_id
```

## Given a Composition, retrieve all the Translation Sources, with Languages and Author Names

```sql
SELECT * FROM compositions
JOIN translation_sources ON translation_sources.composition_id = compositions.id
JOIN languages ON languages.id = translation_sources.language_id
WHERE composition_id= 1
```

## Given any Shabad ID (from any Composition), retrieve the possible Translations

```sql
SELECT * FROM lines
JOIN shabads ON shabads.id = lines.shabad_id
JOIN translations ON lines.id = translations.line_id
WHERE shabad_id = 'W9Z'
ORDER BY lines.order_id
```

## Given any Shabad ID (from any Composition and every Source), retrieve the English Transliterations

```sql
SELECT * FROM lines
JOIN shabads ON shabads.id = lines.shabad_id
JOIN transliterations ON lines.id = transliterations.line_id
JOIN languages ON languages.id = transliterations.language_id
WHERE shabad_id = 'W9Z' AND languages.name_english = 'English'
ORDER BY lines.order_id
```

## Given some Lines, retrieve the Dr. Sant Singh Khalsa English Translations

```sql
SELECT * FROM lines
JOIN translations ON lines.id = translations.line_id
JOIN translation_sources ON translation_sources.id = translations.translation_source_id
WHERE shabad_id = 'W9Z'
AND translation_sources.name_english = 'Dr. Sant Singh Khalsa'
ORDER BY order_id
```

**Note:** it is preferable to select a translation source by its `id`, than a text value, unlike the example above, since text values can change.

## Fetch all the Lines for a given Bani using SGPC

```sql
SELECT * FROM lines
JOIN bani_lines ON bani_lines.line_id = lines.id
JOIN line_content ON line_content.line_id = lines.id
WHERE bani_lines.bani_id = 1 AND line_content.source_id = 1
ORDER BY order_id
```

Fetch a list of Banis and their corresponding `id`s with `SELECT * FROM banis`.

## Fetch all the Shabads for a given Writer

```sql
SELECT * FROM lines
JOIN shabads ON shabads.id = lines.shabad_id
WHERE writer_id = 3
```

Fetch a list of writers and their `id`s with `SELECT * FROM writers`.

## Fetch all Sections and Subsections for all Sources

```sql
SELECT * FROM compositions
JOIN sections ON sections.composition_id = compositions.id
JOIN subsections ON subsections.section_id = sections.id
```
