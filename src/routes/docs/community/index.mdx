## Mission

Our mission at Shabad OS is to learn about Shabad and make it universally accessible to every person on the planet.

## Open-Source

We have multiple open source projects, in the hopes of supporting long-term open collaboration. We believe most people can join in, with our low barrier to participation. We work with the understanding that these projects can be handed off to future generations.

Our intention is to signal a safe open-source community. We welcome all people to contribute, and pledge in return to value them as whole human beings. We want to foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and understanding.

## Code of Conduct

By participating at Shabad OS, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct, the [Contributor Covenant](/docs/community/code-of-conduct).

## Governance

Shabad OS follows a "Founder-Leader" governance model. Our leaders are considered "Benevolent Dictators For Life" or BDFL for short. This model is common among new startups or (as is the case with Shabad OS) for those with few actual contributors.

Our BDFLs:

- [@Harjot1Singh](https://github.com/Harjot1Singh)
- [@bhajneet](https://github.com/bhajneet)

## Roles

These are the roles we recognize within the Shabad OS community:

- **Author**
- **Maintainer**
- **Contributor**
- **Committer**

In our projects, **Authors**, **Maintainers**, and **Committers** are the only ones with commit access. The **Author** starts a project. The **Maintainer** directs and improves a project. The **Committer** has the privilege of commit access. These roles can overlap (e.g. one person could be the author, maintainer, and sole committer).

A **Contributor** could be anyone that otherwise participates in the community. Of course they are those that have merged a pull request. But they could also be anyone that comments on an issue or pull request. Perhaps they help triage issues with labels/follow-ups. And they could even be marketers or event organizers for the project. Basically anyone that has shown themselves to the community has then crossed the line from being a user to a **Contributor**.

**Contributors** can be promoted based on their community track record, ability to understand the org's vision, and their communication skills. If someone wishes to take on more responsibility, they should contact one of the BDFLs listed above.
