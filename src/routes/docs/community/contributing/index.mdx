## Proofreading

Core to Shabad OS is the actual ਸ਼ਬਦ or _shabad_. Most of our contributors tend to be proofreaders, since it is so essential to our organization. The more we confirm the accuracy of the database, the greater credibility the project has. Which then leads to more trust and understanding.

Help proofread the database to ensure it is exactly matching its sources. Get in contact with us to learn which sources to prioritize. And read our guide to [learn how to proofread](/support/learn-how-to-proofread). If you have any questions, please get in touch. This is a very important contribution, and we definitely want to make sure people are able to do it easily and effectively.
