# Maintainer Guidelines

This document is intended for maintainers of a Shabad OS project. If you're looking for other ways to help, please see [how to contribute](/docs/community/contributing)!

Maintainers agree to abide by our Code of Conduct, the [Contributor Covenant](/docs/community/code-of-conduct). In addition to reading this organization-level document, you should refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file inside the specific project repo.

## PR Merge

- Pull requests should be squashed or rebased.
- Commit messages on `main` branch should conform to our [git commit message guidelines](/docs/community/coding-guidelines#commit-messages).

It is good to familiarize yourself with the release workflow/ci. For example, version bumps may be looking at a git commit message's _type_ or a standalone line like "BREAKING CHANGE".

## Release

Where possible, Shabad OS is using GitHub Actions for incrementing the software version and publishing a release. Again, familiarize yourself with whatever workflow/ci script is in the repo.
