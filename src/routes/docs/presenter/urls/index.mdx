# URL Endpoints

Shabad OS has a web URL for each page in the desktop app. You can view the display, controller, settings, and more through web URLs anywhere on the same network.

---

`/` - The empty endpoint points to the default Shabad OS Presenter page (Users can get a controller from this page using the plus sign in the bottom right and then fullscreening the controller)

`/controller/search?controllerOnly=true` - A fullscreened controller in the search activity

`/overlay`- HTML file showing all relevant fields of currently activated line. Can be styled/customized by CSS. Learn [how to add an overlay to live streams](/support/add-bani-captions-to-a-live-stream) for bani captions.

## Find the URL of the device

The device running Shabad OS has an IP address. If the same device is running Shabad OS, you may simply use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` for the IP address (i.e. with port: `http://localhost:1699/` or `http://127.0.0.1:1699/`).

If you'd like to connect through the same network on a different device, you may find the IP address of the Shabad OS server's device by clicking **About** in the Shabad OS Presenter's Settings window.

## Example scenario

For example, if the device running Shabad OS has an IP address of `192.168.0.128`, then the url for the overlay endpoint would be `http://192.168.0.128:1699/overlay`. This could be used in a browser by any device on the same network. Allowing someone to use Shabad OS from one device and live stream from another.

## Troubleshoot the IP address

In case you cannot find the IP address using the Shabad OS desktop app, use the built-in system tools for your OS.

**Windows**

<Media src='/media/ip-address-windows-task-manager.png' alt='Task Manager' />

1. Open the **Task Manager** by either right-clicking the taskbar or using the hotkey `ctrl+shift+esc`.
1. Select the **Performance** tab, then select the Ethernet/Wi-Fi being used to connect to the network.

**macOS**

1. Open **System Preferences** from the Apple icon in the menubar.
1. Select **Network**, then select the Ethernet/Wi-Fi being used to connect to the network.
