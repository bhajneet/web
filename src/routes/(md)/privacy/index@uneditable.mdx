# Privacy

At Shabad OS we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. We try our best to avoid collecting, using, and sharing your personal information where possible. If we believe we can do something important with your data, we will make it abundantly clear to you what we are collecting, how we are going to use it, and who (if anyone) we will be sharing it with. We design our products to protect your privacy and to provide control over any shared personal information.

## Shabad OS Privacy Policy

Updated December 24, 2021

The Shabad OS Privacy Policy outlines how Shabad OS collects, uses, and shares your personal information.

In addition to this document, you can also access our Privacy Policy through our products that request your personal data. The product specific Privacy Policy can be found in its respective Settings or as part of the interface when it is being requested.

When Shabad OS requests your information, you will be given an opportunity to review what is being collected, how it will be used, and whether we will be sharing that information with any third-parties. Product specific information can be viewed in the settings related to the feature requesting your data.

If there is a change to this Privacy Policy, we will do our best to post an advance notice and contact you directly about the change if we have your data on file.

Please <a href="mailto:team@shabados.com">contact us</a> if you have any questions.

## What is considered Personal Data at Shabad OS?

Any data that can be used to identify an individual is considered personal data. Some examples include your name, birthdate, or email address. Any personal data we share with third parties are not subject to our Privacy Policy and different rules may apply based on their privacy policies.

## Your Privacy Rights at Shabad OS

Any person can view, modify, or delete their personal data shared to Shabad OS. No person will be discriminated against or receive lesser service than another. There are situations where, due to legal reasons, we are unable to comply with these Privacy Rights. For example if we are legally obligated to keep a record to comply with law, we will be unable to delete that personal data. In addition, we claim the right to keep some personal data if it is necessary for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for safety or security concerns. Other reasons where your privacy request may be denied are if it concerns the privacy of others, is frivolous or with the intent to inconvenience, or if it would be extremely impractical to do so.

Shabad OS does not and will not sell your data. If you wish to opt-out of sharing your data, you may do so through the Settings of any Shabad OS related product. Please <a href="mailto:team@shabados.com">contact us</a> if you have any questions.

## How Shabad OS Uses Personal Data

We may also use other personal data that you have agreed to share with us.

Shabad OS strives to keep personal data for as short of a time as possible. Or in other words, to keep personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose that it was collected for. We retain your personal data for the period it is required. If we believe the data must be retained, then we will work to retain it for the shortest period of time possible.
