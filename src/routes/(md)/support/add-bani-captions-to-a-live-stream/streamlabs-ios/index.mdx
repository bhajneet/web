# Add Bani Captions to Streamlabs on iOS

Live Stream Bani Captions From an iPhone With Shabad OS + Streamlabs

## Understand how to use Streamlabs with Shabad OS

This only works on the iOS version of Streamlabs until the developers fix an issue requiring "https" links on their Android app. A laptop or desktop is required to run the Shabad OS Presenter app. Both the iPhone and the laptop/desktop running Shabad OS must be able to communicate with each other on the same network.

## Add a URL layer to the Streamlabs Editor

Even though the hint text in Streamlabs mentions `https`, be sure to use `http` instead. For example, if the Overlay URL is `192.168.1.200:1699/overlay`, then use `http://192.168.1.200:1699/overlay` for Streamlabs.

1. Tap the **Menu Button** (=) on the top left.
2. In **Advanced Mode**, tap **Editor**.
3. Tap **Layers** on the top right.
4. Tap the **Plus Button** (+) on the top right.
5. Tap **Add a custom item**.
6. Tap **Add a URL**.
7. Use the Overlay URL from Shabad OS to fill in **URL**.
8. Tap **Add**.
9. Resize the layer.
10. Tap **Save** in the top left corner.

## Resize the layer in Streamlabs

Here are some tips for resizing the layer in Streamlabs.

- Move the layer by tapping and dragging the center of the layer.
- Resize the layer in the Streamlabs Editor by tapping and dragging either the squares in the corners or the lines on each side of the layer.
- An easy way to full screen a layer is to move the layer to the bottom left and then use the top right corner to resize it all the way to the top right.
- When switching from landscape to portrait mode, it is possible to reset all the layers to their original size by tapping **Reset** in the top right corner. If the **Reset** button is being covered by the Overlay layer, it might be easier to simply delete and recreate the Overlay layer.
- Play with different heights to control the font size. Decreasing the height of the Shabad OS Overlay will make the font sizes smaller. This is especially helpful for portrait mode.
