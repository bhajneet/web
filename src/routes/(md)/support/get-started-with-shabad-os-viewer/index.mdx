# Get Started With Viewer

The Shabad OS Viewer makes it easier to see what is available in the Shabad OS Database. It is designed to be used for proofreading and research purposes.

## Understand the Basics

When first visiting the website, you will be directed to Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. At the top of the webpage, there is a header with menus for collections, about, and interface. At the bottom of the screen there is a navbar to progress with arrows. It is also possible to change lines using the `<Tab>` and `<Shift>+<Tab>` hotkeys or the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard.

Use the collections menu to see other compositions. Use the about menu to see hotkeys. Use the interface menu to change the zoom level or to fullscreen the app.

Clicking on a line (or hitting `<Enter>` on your keyboard) will open an in-depth view containing information from the Database. The information includes punjabi translations and their English counterparts (courtesy of [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)).

When viewing a line, it is also possible to click on any of the individual words (indicated with a blue underline) to open a new tab/window pointing at a dictionary result (courtesy of [Sri Granth](http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.dictionary?Param=)).

Lastly, it is possible to submit proofreading evidence for any line by clicking on the flag icon in the top right corner.

## Proofread with the Viewer

The Viewer is actually used internally by the Shabad OS team to improve the accuracy of the Database. See the video below to get an idea of how easy it is. If you're interested in learning more, please check out our [proofreading guide](/support/learn-how-to-proofread).
