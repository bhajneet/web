Shabad is commonly defined as a hymn, but could its meaning be something more elusive? Our goal is to learn about Shabad through the various writings of the Sikh philosophy and then to make them more accessible for others to learn from as well. Hence the OS in our name – It stands for open-source.

The term open-source originates in a software movement to support open collaboration. Basically, people desired to voluntarily cooperate together to create something better. Similarly, we believe in an open-source Sikh philosophy. Everyone can join, there are no barriers to participation. The work that is completed can be handed off to the following generations.
